## Planning with A.I for UX

Brainstorming with GitHub Copilot was instrumental in developing the foundations for this project. By leveraging Copilot's AI-driven suggestions, I was able to quickly generate ideas for key features, user stories, and database design. This collaborative approach ensured that I covered all essential aspects of the project, from user authentication to movie database management, while also considering future enhancements. Copilot's ability to provide context-aware recommendations significantly streamlined the planning process, allowing me to focus on creating a comprehensive and engaging platform for 80s horror movie enthusiasts.

## AI-Prompted Image Generation

Using AI prompting for image generation, I aimed to create a hero image that captured the essence of 80s-style horror comic books. After experimenting with several AI-generated suggestions, we found the perfect image that embodied the retro horror aesthetic we desired. However, to make the image more usable for the website, I needed to manipulate it further in Gimp image software. This involved adjusting colors, enhancing details, and ensuring it seamlessly integrated with our site's design, ultimately resulting in a visually striking hero image that sets the tone for "Vault of the Surreal."

## Agile Development Process

## User Stories

MoSCoW Prioritization

MoSCoW prioritization was used in this project to clearly define and manage the essential features and functionalities required for the "Vault of the Surreal" website. By categorizing tasks into Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves, the development team can focus on delivering the most critical aspects first, ensuring that the core objectives are met within the project timeline. This method helps in making informed decisions and efficiently allocating time to achieve a successful MVP launch.

With CoPilot I was able to identigy core reuqirement for our user stories.

## Debugging

1.
![Error URLs](readme-images/errors/1%20urls.png)

### Solution.
 I encountered a bug related to the URL pattern configuration. After exploring, I discovered the bug was caused by a slug link not being the last in the order of URL patterns. To fix this, I ensured that the slug pattern was placed at the end of the URL configuration list. This adjustment prevents conflicts with other URL patterns and ensures that the correct view is rendered when a slug is accessed.

2.
![Invalid Python](readme-images/errors/invalid_python.png)

### Solution.

Stack overflow offered a working suggestion whichj i corrected within the runtime.txt file.

![Stack Overflow Solution](readme-images/stackoverflow.png)

3,
![Uncaught TypeError](readme-images/uncaught_type_error.png)

### Solution

This error was caused by an undefined variable being accessed in the JavaScript code. To resolve this issue, I reviewed the code to ensure all variables were properly defined before being used.

### A.I. for Improving Code and Performance

Leveraging GitHub Copilot for improving code performance was a game-changer for this project. By utilizing Copilot's AI-driven suggestions, I was able to identify and implement performance optimizations across various parts of the codebase. This included refactoring inefficient code, optimizing database queries, and enhancing the overall responsiveness of the website. Copilot's ability to provide context-aware recommendations helped streamline the optimization process, ensuring that the website runs smoothly and efficiently, providing a better user experience for 80s horror movie enthusiasts.



![Insecure Requests](readme-images/errors/insecure_requests.png)

### Solution

The low score in best practices was due to an insecure HTTP requests being made instead of HTTPS for Cloudinary access. To fix this, I updated all external resource URLs in the code to use HTTPS, ensuring secure communication and compliance with modern web standards. However, Lighthouse performance still indicated an issue. By using Copilot, I found that implementing a 'Content Security Policy' (CSP) could enforce HTTPS requests. Copilot's initial suggestion was:

### Examples of Using GitHub Copilot for this project:

1. **Debugging**:
   - Copilot assisted in identifying and fixing bugs by suggesting corrections and improvements to the existing code.

2. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**:
   - Copilot recommended adding meta tags, alt attributes for images, and improving the overall structure of the HTML to enhance SEO.

3. **Code Improvements**:
   - Copilot provided suggestions for cleaner, more maintainable code, including best practices for Django development.

4. **Debugging**:
   - Copilot assisted in identifying and fixing bugs by suggesting corrections and improvements to the existing code.

   5. **Code Creation**:
      - Copilot suggested appropriate labeling and docstrings to make our code easier to read and maintain.
      - Copilot assisted in generating the database model via recommended prompts, ensuring a well-structured and efficient database design.

<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' https:; img-src 'self' https:; script-src 'self' https:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https:; upgrade-insecure-requests;">
```

Despite this, the issue persisted. After several prompts with knowing we were on the right path, Copilot suggested adding 'block-all-mixed-content' to the policy, which resolved the issue.

```html
 <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' https:; img-src 'self' https:; script-src 'self' https:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https:; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content;">

## Unit Testing with GitHub Copilot

Leveraging GitHub Copilot for creating unit tests was instrumental in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the "Vault of the Surreal" project. Copilot's AI-driven suggestions helped generate initial test cases for various functionalities, including user authentication, movie database operations, and user interactions.

### Enhancing Test Accuracy

To improve the accuracy and completeness of the tests generated by Copilot, several adjustments were made:

1. **Refining Test Logic**:
   - Covered edge cases, including invalid inputs and exception handling.
   - Added checks to ensure database operations (add, edit, delete) work correctly.

2. **Improving Coverage**:
   - Expanded tests to cover more scenarios and critical features.
   - Included tests for user permissions to ensure only authorized actions.

3. **Optimizing Performance**:
   - Streamlined test setup and teardown to reduce redundancy and speed up execution.
   - Used mock objects to simplify tests and improve reliability.

### Our unit testing at work.

![Unit Test](readme-images/validation/unit-test.png)

By leveraging Copilot's suggestions and making necessary adjustments, we ensured that our unit tests were robust, accurate, and comprehensive, contributing to the overall quality and reliability of the "Vault of the Surreal" project.
